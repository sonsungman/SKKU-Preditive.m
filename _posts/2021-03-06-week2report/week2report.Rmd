### Introduction

The aim of this report is both data exploring  and visualizing.

First of all, I will explore given dataset 'AmesHousing'. Exploring dataset includes to look at the number of observations in the dataset, variables in the data, structure of the data and so on.

Next, I will use the ggplot function to learn more about a given dataset with a few visualizations. Through this visualization, it can also get some useful insights into the dataset.

Finally, with the information on the datasets that we have learned from the above analysis, I will introduce some model approaches that are suitable for data analysis and conclude this report.
