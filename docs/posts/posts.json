    "contents": "\nIntroduction\nThe aim of this report is linear regression modeling for sales price forecasting.\nLast week, I explored and visualized Ames Housing data to find independent variables appropriate for home sales price prediction modeling.\nAmong the three problem (regression problem, classification problems, and clustering problem) presented in ISL, sales price prediction corresponds to regression problem.\nMeanwhile, this report did not address the issue of VIF or the concept of \\(R^{2}\\) or data pre-processing and so on. I will address these concepts in further report later.\nSo first, I review the contents of the previous report again. Second, I rethink feedback and peer reviews on my data analysis report and consider some new facts. Third, I build a multi-regression model to predict the sales price based on the previous results. Finally, I use train data to build prediction model and make prediction with test data.\nReview of previous Report\nIn the last report, I was able to identify some variables that could affect house prices and fact through data exploration and visualization.\nThe presence of swimming pools and pavement conditions on the streets are insufficient to affect housing prices.\n‘Overall Qual’ column (Rates the overall material and finish of the house) is a positive correlation with house price.\nThe larger the size of the house, of course the higher the price of the house, but the size of the house does not seem to be a decisive factor.\nThe capacity of a garage in a house appears to be a variable that affects house price.\nThe timing of house construction or remodeling will affect house prices.\nPeer review and feedback from the Professor Lee\nThere is no reason not to use house data built or remodeled before 1980 for modeling. Therefore, there may be a way to combine pre-1980 data into the 1980.\nThe variable regarding the capacity of the garage may be correlated with the Lot Area variable. Therefore, it is necessary to rethink the consideration of both variables in modeling.\nThe neighborhood around the house affects the price.\nBuilding a multi-regression model\nBased on the year of architecture or remodeling, data is divided before and after 1980 and analyzed using multiple regression analyses, respectively.\n\n\nShow code\n\n## Data divided\n\n  data1<- ames_raw %>%\n    filter(`Year Remod/Add` <= 1980)\n\n  data2<- ames_raw %>%\n    filter(`Year Remod/Add` > 1980)\n\n\n\nAs an independent variable of the model, I use Lot Area, Overall Qual,and Garage Cars. It was modeled by dividing the housing according to the area in which it was located.\n1\n\n\nShow code\n\n  nrow(data1)\n\n\n[1] 1232\n\nShow code\n\n  data1 %>% \n      group_by(Neighborhood) %>%\n      summarize(count = n())  \n\n\n# A tibble: 21 x 2\n   Neighborhood count\n   <chr>        <int>\n 1 Blueste          6\n 2 BrDale          29\n 3 BrkSide         68\n 4 ClearCr         22\n 5 CollgCr         31\n 6 Crawfor         49\n 7 Edwards        120\n 8 Gilbert          7\n 9 Greens           6\n10 IDOTRR          69\n# … with 11 more rows\n\n\n\nShow code\n\n  nested_df<-data1 %>% \n    group_by(Neighborhood) %>%\n    nest() %>% ungroup(Neighborhood)\n    \n  nested_df %>%\n   mutate(model = map(data, ~lm(SalePrice ~ `Lot Area` + `Overall Qual` + `Garage Cars` , data=.))) %>%\n    transmute(Neighborhood, map_df(model, ~summary(.)$coefficients[,1]))\n\n\n# A tibble: 21 x 5\n   Neighborhood `(Intercept)` `\\`Lot Area\\`` `\\`Overall Qual\\``\n   <chr>                <dbl>          <dbl>              <dbl>\n 1 NAmes                8410.           2.64             17871.\n 2 Gilbert            184658.          -1.27              -679.\n 3 NWAmes             -24896.           3.78              8823.\n 4 BrDale             157231.          13.5             -13583.\n 5 NPkVill            203369.          -3.86             -9548.\n 6 SawyerW            162228.         -11.7               8045.\n 7 Sawyer               9677.           2.03             17886.\n 8 Greens             413043.         -57.8                 NA \n 9 BrkSide              2206.           3.65             16478.\n10 OldTown             -4018.           2.70             15994.\n# … with 11 more rows, and 1 more variable: `Garage Cars` <dbl>\n\nAfter multiple regression analyses based on the three independent variables mentioned above with house data prior to 1980, the estimated parameters were presented by neighborhood.\n2\nThe following is a multi-regression analysis model of houses by region using data from 1980 onwards.\n\n\nShow code\n\n  nrow(data2)\n\n\n[1] 1698\n\nShow code\n\n  data2 %>% \n      group_by(Neighborhood) %>%\n      summarize(count = n())  \n\n\n# A tibble: 27 x 2\n   Neighborhood count\n   <chr>        <int>\n 1 Blmngtn         28\n 2 Blueste          4\n 3 BrDale           1\n 4 BrkSide         40\n 5 ClearCr         22\n 6 CollgCr        236\n 7 Crawfor         54\n 8 Edwards         74\n 9 Gilbert        158\n10 Greens           2\n# … with 17 more rows\n\n\n\nShow code\n\n  nested_df2<-data2 %>% \n    group_by(Neighborhood) %>%\n    nest() %>% ungroup(Neighborhood)\n\nnested_df2 %>%\n   mutate(model = map(data, ~lm(SalePrice ~ `Lot Area` + `Overall Qual` + `Garage Cars` , data=.))) \n\n\n# A tibble: 27 x 3\n   Neighborhood data                model \n   <chr>        <list>              <list>\n 1 Gilbert      <tibble [158 × 81]> <lm>  \n 2 StoneBr      <tibble [51 × 81]>  <lm>  \n 3 NWAmes       <tibble [46 × 81]>  <lm>  \n 4 Somerst      <tibble [182 × 81]> <lm>  \n 5 NAmes        <tibble [115 × 81]> <lm>  \n 6 NridgHt      <tibble [166 × 81]> <lm>  \n 7 Blmngtn      <tibble [28 × 81]>  <lm>  \n 8 NoRidge      <tibble [71 × 81]>  <lm>  \n 9 SawyerW      <tibble [107 × 81]> <lm>  \n10 Sawyer       <tibble [47 × 81]>  <lm>  \n# … with 17 more rows\n\n3\nNow, I apply the train data to the model above.

property in Ames, Iowa from 2006 to 2010.\nIt’s easy to manipulate, model, and visualize because the dataset have a structure of ‘tidy dataset’.\nIn the dataset, each row represents a single observation, with a total of 2930 such rows. That means there are 2930 house observations. On the other hand, there are 81 distinct features for a single house, which are shown in each column.\nThe last 82nd column contains information about the sale price of the house. In this respect, 80 feature variables for housing in this dataset can be appropriately used to generate predictive models of house prices. This means that the predictive model can be created by designating house prices as dependent variables and designating several characteristic variables of house as independent variables.\nNow, let’s filter some characteristic variables of the house and visualize them with the price of the house, and think about some insights into the data.\nVisualizing Data\nFirst of all, I focus on ‘Street’ column. Because it is categorical variable, it seems appropriate to use a bar chart.\n\n\nShow code\n\nggplot(data = ames_raw) +\n  geom_bar(mapping = aes(x=Street))\n\n\n\n\nAccording to the chart above, most of the houses are located on Pave type street. Thus, on this dataset, the Street variable does not appear to be able to give significant information.\nThen, let’s think about the year the house was built. I think the year that house was built would mean a lot and it would have a major impact on house price.\n\n\nShow code\n\nggplot(data = ames_raw) +\n  geom_bar(mapping = aes(x=`Year Built`))\n\n\n\n\nSince I think that the year of construction and the year of remodeling have a major impact on the quality of house, I consider only houses that have been built or remodeled since 1980. Without remodeling, the building year would appear in the remodeling year, so I draw graph with the remodeling year and sales price.\n\n\nShow code\n\n  preceding <- ames_raw %>%\n    filter(`Year Remod/Add` > 1980)\n  ggplot(data=preceding, mapping = aes( y= SalePrice , x = `Year Remod/Add`)) +\n    geom_point()\n\n\n\n\nFurthermore of here, let’s look at the relationship between the size and price of a house after 1980.\n\n\nShow code\n\n  ggplot(data = preceding, mapping = aes(x =`Lot Area`, y = `SalePrice`)) +\n  geom_point()\n\n\n\n\nNow, let’s look at the relationship between the size of the garage in the house and the price of the house in the house data that has been remodeled or built since 1980. I think that the larger the garage, the higher the house price, the more likely it is to hypothesize that it has a positive relationship between the two variables.\n\n\nShow code\n\n  ggplot(data = preceding, mapping = aes(x=`Garage Cars`,y = SalePrice)) +\n  geom_point()\n\n\n\n\nThen, let’s think about the size of the pool. Look at the price information of house with swimming pool after the 1980s in the graph below.\n\n\nShow code\n\n   preceding_pool<-preceding %>%\n  filter(`Pool Area`>0)\n  ggplot(data=preceding_pool, mapping = aes(x=`Pool Area`,y=SalePrice)) +\n  geom_point()\n\n\n\n\nAccording to the graph above, there are many houses without swimming pool and the fact that there are swimming pool does not mean that house price will rise.\nLastly, let’s take a look at the overall assessment of house and the year of construction or remodeling of house since 1980.\n\n\nShow code\n\n  ggplot(data = preceding, mapping = aes(y = SalePrice, x = `Overall Qual`)) +\n  geom_point()\n\n\n\n\nConclusion\nI investigated the dataset ‘Ames Housing’ through data exploration. About the 2930 house observational data, 81 characteristic variables provided information about house. Furthermore, several feature variables from selected observations through certain criteria provide meaningful information by visualizing house price.\nIn light of the graph shown above,\nThe larger the size of the house, of course the higher the price of the house, but the size of the house does not seem to be a decisive factor.\nThe capacity of a garage in a house appears to be a variable that affects house price.\nAs with previous ‘Street’ type column, swimming pool is not a big influence on house price in this data because there are many homes without swimming pool.\n‘Overall Qual’ column (Rates the overall material and finish of the house) is a positive correlation with house price.\nTherefore, if I make a model for predicting house price, I will set the size of the house, garage size of the house, Overall Quality, and the year of construction or remodeling as an independent variable and use observations from the 1980s to estimate the model’s parameters.\nFinally, I think that multiple regression analyses seem appropriate.\n\n\n\n",
