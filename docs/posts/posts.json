Exploring dataset includes to look at the number of observations in the dataset, variables in the data, structure of the data and so on.\nNext, I will use the ggplot function to learn more about a given dataset with a few visualizations. Through this visualization, it can also get some useful insights into the dataset.\nFinally, with the information on the datasets we have learned from the above analysis, I will introduce some model approaches that are suitable for data analysis and conclude this report.\nExploring Dataset\n\n\n\n",
